# COM Tutorial

This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive tutorials on Component Object Model (COM) programming. These tutorials range from the basics of COM interfaces and classes to more advanced topics such as Connection Points, Sinks, Threading, and Interop. Each tutorial includes fully implemented source code for a deeper and more practical understanding of the topic.

## What is COM?

Component Object Model (COM) is a binary-interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It is used to enable inter-process communication and dynamic object creation in a large range of programming languages.
